# fairtradeupdate
This application is designed for Fair Trade USA. They needed a application that allowed for producers in third world countries to provide feedback about how they spent the extra revenue they earned called "premium". Under their current system, producers were not incentivized to respond to their yearly surveys because it takes too much time and only have access to legacy technology. This application integrates the ubiquitous email to data collection. It auto-sends emails with only a couple specific questions for a certain time interval; then, it parses received emails to obtain responses and places them in a database. This data can then be further analyzed.
